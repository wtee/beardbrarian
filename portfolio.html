              <h4>Alma Enumerator</h4>
              <p><a href="https://bitbucket.org/wtee/alma_enumerator">Alma Enumerator</a>
                is set of Python scripts to update enumeration and chronology
                information in Alma, an integrated library system made by Ex Libris. It parses
                item record description fields, extracts enumeration and chronology information
                and updates the item record's enumeration and chronology fields. This is particularly
                useful cases when a library has volume, issue and date information saved in item
                description fields but not in the corresponding enumeration and chronology fields.</p>

             <h4>Mobile Orthodox Reference</h4>
             <p><a href="http://slissrv01.iowa.uiowa.edu/~wteal/mobile/project/app.php">Mobile Orthodox Reference</a> is
             a mobile website  is intended to serve as a quick reference for busy Eastern Orthodox travelers looking for
             a church in an unfamiliar locale or who wants an easy way to keep up on their daily readings and religious calendar.
             It can also serve as a general reference for any Orthodox person. The site leverages HTML5's geolocation to
             find churches near a user's current location. The user can use the icons at the bottom of the site to navigate
             to pages that have the day's Bible readings, the fast requirements for the day, and the saints being celebrated
             on the current day. The user can also view an information page that has a key for the various church icons used
             on the site's map and to learn more about the site.</p>

             and social tagging for metadata creation. It was designed and coded by
             myself and Xi Wang.</p>
