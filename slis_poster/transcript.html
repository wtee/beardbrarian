    <p>In 1890, Samuel D. Warren and Louis Brandeis declared that "Recent inventions 
    and business methods" made clear the need to secure for the individual "the right 
    'to be let alone'" because new technology had "invaded the sacred precincts of 
    private and domestic life", making it simple for that which was whispered in the 
    closet to be proclaimed from the house-tops. Their opinion has only become more 
    relevant in the age of mobile technology.</p>
    <p>The rapid proliferation of e-readers and mobile devices has opened new 
    information opportunities for library patrons and new platforms for library 
    services. Unfortunately, mobile devices make it almost effortless for companies, 
    governments, and criminals to surreptitiously gather massive amounts of personal 
    information.</p>
    <p>Whether it's Amazon keeping tabs on the reading habits of Kindle users or 
    popular apps like Angry Birds gathering personally identifiable information, the 
    private and domestic lives of patrons are regularly invaded by the devices they use 
    most. Even when the information collected is supposed to be anonymous, studies of 
    data sets collected by AOL and Netflix have shown that individuals can still be identified.</p>
    <p>Recent revelations of mobile-specific surveillance operations by the NSA and
    British intelligence further underscore the importance of protecting patron privacy.</p>
    <p>There are a variety of ways librarians can maximize the privacy of their mobile 
    patrons. These include educating patrons about privacy concerns, helping them 
    understand the privacy settings on their devices, staying informed about trends in 
    mobile technology, and advocating privacy protection. Establishing a privacy policy 
    that addresses mobile devices and working to ensure that vendors adhere to it is 
    also important. Librarians may even create their own platforms for mobile services 
    or refuse to work with vendors who violate patron privacy.</p>
    <p>As librarians work to explore the benefits of mobile devices, it is paramount that 
    we continue to ensure our patrons' right to be let alone.</p>
